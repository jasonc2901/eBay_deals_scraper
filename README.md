# eBay_deals_scraper
This project is a Python web scraper that retrieves new deals everyday and displays the top ones in a Tkinter GUI.

I used the BeautifulSoup4 and request modules to do the web scraping and retrieve product details from eBay's website, I then designed a Tkinter GUI that utlises all of this data and displays it to the user.

# Getting it up and running

- first clone/download the code into a repository on your local machine
- in terminal navigate to the folder and create a virtual environment
    - virtualenv env
- enter the environment by running

- install requirements 
    - pip install -r requirements.txt


# Run the program

- Once the requirements have been installed successfully you can run the tool simply by calling
    - python3 gui.py
